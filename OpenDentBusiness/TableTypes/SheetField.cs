		///<summary>Mostly for OutputText and InputField types.  Each sheet typically has a main datatable type.  For OutputText types, FieldName is usually the string representation of the database column for the main table.  For other tables, it can be of the form table.Column.  There may also be extra fields available that are not strictly pulled from the database.  Extra fields will start with lowercase to indicate that they are not pure database fields.  The list of available fields for each type in SheetFieldsAvailable.  Users can pick from that list.  Likewise, InputField types are internally tied to actions to persist the data.  So they are also hard coded and are available in SheetFieldsAvailable.  For static images, this is the full file name including extension, but without path.  Static images paths are reconstructed by looking in the AtoZ folder, SheetImages folder.  For a PatImage, this now contains the long FK to the document.  A join must be done to that table to find the filename.   When a SheetField has a fieldType of Parameter, then the FieldName stores the name of the parameter.</summary>
		public string FieldName;
		///<summary>For OutputText, this value is set before printing.  This is the data obtained from the database and ready to print.  For StaticText, this is copied from the sheetFieldDef, but in-line fields like [this] will have been filled.  For an archived sheet retrieved from the database (all SheetField rows), this value will have been saved and will not be filled again automatically.  For a parameter fieldtype, this will store the value of the parameter. For a Drawing fieldtype, this will be the point data for the lines.  The format would look similar to this: 45,68;48,70;49,72;0,0;55,88;etc.  It's simply a sequence of points, separated by semicolons.  For CheckBox, it will either be an X or empty.  For SigBox, the first char will be 0 or 1 to indicate SigIsTopaz, and all subsequent chars will be the Signature itself.   For Pat Image, this contains image size and image position info.  Like this: "X=0,Y=20,W=100,H=60".  This is initially generated automatically to fit the object.  It can later be changed by the user to "zoom and pan" within the confines of the object.</summary>
